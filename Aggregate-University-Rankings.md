Aggregate University Rankings (2020)
================

Many lists of global university rankings have been produced, each with a
different methodology, in an attempt to quantitatively define which
universities are the best overall. Of these numerous lists, three in
particular stand out as more cited and trusted than the others: the
Academic Ranking of World Universities, the QS World University
Rankings, and the Times Higher Education World University Rankings. This
document displays the top universities by taking the mean scores of all
three lists for each university.

DISCLAIMER: This is not meant to be a statement on which universities
are best or better than others. It is simply intended to be informative
about what kind of information can be obtained by combining the above
ranking lists. Moreover, this document does not make any claim on how
best to combine the scores. A nonweighted mean is chosen for simplicity.
This may change in the future. Only universities for which a single
numeric score existed across all three lists appear in the table. This
document is not intended to profit off the three ranking lists. For more
information on individual methodologies, please visit the respective
websites.
